Hi Bockjoo,

there is a possibility called variant symlinks available in cvmfs.  It
allows you to use an environment variable as symlink destination, so you
can change the real location per worker node.

CMS repository uses this feature for
/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/etc/SITECONF/local, which points to $CMS_LOCAL_SITE.
 This variable is set in /etc/cvmfs/config.d/cms.cern.ch.{conf.local}.
This link as been created like
ln -s '$(CMS_LOCAL_SITE)' /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/etc/SITECONF/local

I'm on vacation until next week but you can follow this up with RenÃ©in
'cc).

Cheers,
Jakob
